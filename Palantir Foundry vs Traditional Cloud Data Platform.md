# Palantir Foundry vs Traditional Cloud Data Platform


## Collab


## TL;DR 
Palantir Foundry is an integrated, opinionated, end-to-end data platform that combines data integration, transformation, governance, lineage, ontology modeling,
and operational applications into a single system.
Traditional cloud data platforms (AWS / Azure / GCP stacks) are modular and tool-based, where teams assemble pipelines using separate services for storage,
compute, orchestration, governance, and analytics.


## Overview
Modern data platforms aim to solve:
Data ingestion
Transformation
Governance
Lineage
Security
Analytics
Operational use cases
Two dominant approaches exist:
Approach A — Palantir Foundry
Platform-driven, dataset-centric, tightly integrated.
Approach B — Traditional Cloud Data Platforms
Service-driven, tool-centric, loosely integrated.
This document compares both across architecture, pipeline development, governance, security, and operational usage.


## Architecture Philosophy
Palantir Foundry:-
Foundry provides a single integrated data operating system:
Data ingestion
Transform pipelines
Ontology modeling
Governance
Lineage tracking
Operational applications
Scheduling & orchestration
Access control
All components are built into one platform.
Philosophy:
Declare data products → Platform manages execution, lineage, and governance


Traditional Cloud Platforms
Built using multiple services:
Example (AWS stack):
Storage → S3
Compute → Spark / EMR / Databricks
Warehouse → Redshift / Snowflake
Orchestration → Airflow / Step Functions
Governance → Glue Catalog / Purview
BI → Tableau / Power BI
Philosophy:
Choose best tools → Integrate them yourself


Example 1 — Dataset Transformation
# Palantir Foundry Transform (PySpark)
```bash

from transforms.api import transform, Input, Output
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, when

@transform(
    output=Output("/analytics/claims/claims_enriched"),
    claims=Input("/raw/claims"),
    customers=Input("/master/customers")
)
def compute(output, claims, customers):

    df = claims.join(customers, "customer_id", "left")

    enriched = df.withColumn(
        "risk_flag",
        when(col("claim_amount") > 100000, "HIGH").otherwise("NORMAL")
    )

    output.write_dataframe(enriched)

```
What this shows

Dataset inputs declared
Output dataset declared
Dependency tracking automatic
No orchestration code required


# Example 2 — Incremental Processing
# Traditional Spark Job (Standalone)
```bash
@transform(
    output=Output("/analytics/sales/daily_incremental"),
    sales=Input("/raw/sales")
)
def compute(ctx, output, sales):

    last_run = ctx.previous_run_timestamp

    incremental_df = sales.dataframe().filter(
        col("ingest_ts") > last_run
    )

    output.write_dataframe(incremental_df)
```
Platform provides:

Previous run context
Incremental execution support
Built-in recompute logic


# Traditional Incremental Merge (Spark + Delta)
```bash
from delta.tables import DeltaTable

delta_table = DeltaTable.forPath(
    spark,
    "s3://bucket/analytics/sales_delta"
)

updates = spark.read.parquet("s3://bucket/raw/sales_new")

delta_table.alias("t").merge(
    updates.alias("s"),
    "t.id = s.id"
).whenMatchedUpdateAll() \
 .whenNotMatchedInsertAll() \
 .execute()

```

Here you must implement:

Merge logic

Idempotency

State handling

# Example 3 — Orchestration
Traditional Airflow DAG
```bash
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.providers.apache.spark.operators.spark_submit import SparkSubmitOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG("claims_pipeline", start_date=datetime(2025,1,1)) as dag:

    spark_job = SparkSubmitOperator(
        task_id="claims_job",
        application="/jobs/claims_job.py",
        conn_id="spark_default"
    )

    spark_job
```
You must manage:

Scheduling
Retries
Dependencies
Monitoring


Foundry Pipeline
```bash
Input datasets → Transform → Output datasets
```


## Why Teams Choose Palantir Foundry Over Traditional Cloud Data Platforms
1. Native Ontology Layer (Not Just Tables — Business Objects)
   Foundry provides a built-in Ontology layer that maps datasets into:

Business objects - Objects represent real-world entities. eg - supplier, Claim, Aircraft, Transaction
Relationships (links) - Links define how objects connect.
Actions - Actions are operations that can be executed on objects.. Eg - Insert Object, Delete Object, Trigger Inspection
Workflows
Operational decisions

This enables:

Operational applications
Decision systems
Human workflows
Scenario modeling
Object-level security

Traditional Cloud Reality

Requires stitching together:
Semantic layer
Graph DB
APIs
App backend
Workflow engine

2. Automatic End-to-End Lineage (Column Level)

Foundry

Automatic lineage capture
Dataset level
Transform level
Column level
Impact analysis built-in
No instrumentation required
Engineers get lineage by default.

Traditional Cloud

Requires:
OpenLineage / DataHub / Collibra
Metadata scanners
Manual tagging
Partial lineage gaps

➡️ Often incomplete or delayed.

3. Built-In Dev → Test → Prod Promotion Model

Foundry

Branch-based data development
Dataset versioning
Transform versioning
Safe promotion workflows
Data diff between versions
Rollback support
Data pipelines behave like software releases.

In Palantir Foundry, data pipelines behave like software releases, not just scheduled jobs.
Instead of manually managing environments and deployments, Foundry provides a native promotion workflow for:
Transforms, Datasets, Pipelines, Ontology changes, Applications
This is built directly into the platform — not added via external CI/CD tooling.

Palantir Foundry includes a built-in Dev → Test → Prod promotion model where data pipelines behave like software releases. Engineers develop changes in isolated branches with fully versioned datasets and transforms, validate outputs using dataset diffs, and promote updates through controlled workflows. Every dataset and transform version is reproducible and rollback-ready. Unlike traditional cloud data platforms — where environment promotion requires custom CI/CD and infrastructure duplication — Foundry provides native, branch-based data development and safe promotion as a platform feature.

Traditional Cloud

Usually requires:
Separate environments
CI/CD tooling
Custom deployment scripts
Manual data validation
➡️ Not platform-native.

4. Dataset Versioning + Time Travel by Default

Foundry

Every dataset is:
Versioned
Snapshot tracked
Reproducible
Rollback capable
Auditable
You can answer:
“What did this dataset look like 3 months ago?”
Instantly.

In Palantir Foundry, datasets are not mutable tables that get overwritten.

Instead, every dataset build creates a new immutable version (snapshot).

```bash
Not: overwrite table
But: create new dataset version
```

In Palantir Foundry, every dataset is automatically versioned and stored as immutable snapshots. Each build produces a new dataset version tied to the exact input versions, transform code, and execution context, making outputs fully reproducible and auditable. Engineers can instantly time-travel to see what a dataset looked like at any point in the past, compare versions, and roll back if needed. Unlike traditional cloud platforms — where table history and time travel require specific storage formats and extra configuration — Foundry provides dataset versioning and historical traceability by default across the platform.

Traditional Cloud

Needs:
Delta Lake / Iceberg / Hudi
Extra configuration
Retention policies
Storage planning

➡️ Not universal across stack.

5. Policy-Aware Data — Security Travels With Data

Foundry

Security is embedded into datasets:
Row-level policies
Column masking
Object-level permissions
Ontology-aware permissions
Policy inheritance downstream
When data flows → policies flow.


In Palantir Foundry, security is embedded directly into datasets and ontology objects, making data policy-aware by design. Row-level filters, column masking, object-level permissions, and ontology-aware access rules are defined once and automatically enforced across transforms, notebooks, applications, and analytics. Security policies also propagate downstream through lineage, so derived datasets inherit upstream protections. This “security travels with data” model reduces policy drift and eliminates the need to reimplement access controls across multiple tools — a common challenge in traditional cloud data platforms.

```bash

User Role: Investigator
Can:
  view Claim
  update Claim status

Cannot:
  delete Claim
  approve Claim payout


```

This supports:

Operational workflows
Case management
Decision systems
Action controls
Traditional Cloud

Security is usually:
Tool-specific
Warehouse-specific
BI-specific
IAM-specific

➡️ Policy drift risk across layers.

6. Operational Applications Built Directly on Data

Foundry

You can build:
Operational apps
Decision workflows
Investigation tools
Case management systems
Supply chain control towers
Directly on top of the same governed data.
No separate app stack required.


Palantir Foundry enables teams to build operational applications directly on top of governed datasets and ontology objects, not just analytics dashboards. Because business entities, relationships, actions, workflows, and security are all native to the platform, organizations can create investigation tools, case management systems, decision workflows, and operational control towers without building a separate backend application stack. Actions taken in these apps are policy-enforced and fully audited, keeping data, decisions, and operations tightly integrated — a capability that typically requires multiple additional systems in traditional cloud architectures.

# Foundry Architecture Pattern
```bash
Datasets
   ↓
Transforms
   ↓
Ontology Objects
   ↓
Actions + Workflows
   ↓
Operational Application
```

Traditional Cloud

Requires:
Separate app platform
API layer
Backend services
Auth integration
Sync with analytics layer

➡️ Higher system fragmentation.

7. Automatic Dependency Recompute

Foundry

When upstream data changes:
Downstream recompute is automatic
Impact graph known
Partial recompute supported
Incremental recompute supported
Engineers don’t manage DAG logic manually.

Palantir Foundry automatically recomputes downstream datasets when upstream data changes because pipeline execution is driven by dataset dependencies rather than manually defined job DAGs. The platform continuously maintains a dependency and impact graph, marks affected datasets as stale, and recomputes only what is necessary. It supports partial and incremental recompute, partition-aware execution, and failure recovery without requiring orchestration code. Engineers declare inputs and outputs — Foundry handles ordering, retries, and recomputation automatically — significantly reducing pipeline management overhead compared to traditional cloud orchestration models.
# What Happens When Upstream Data Changes?
```bash
raw/claims → cleaned_claims → enriched_claims → risk_metrics
```

Traditional Cloud

Requires:
Orchestrator DAG maintenance
Manual dependency modeling
Backfill scripting
➡️ Operationally heavier.

8. Unified Governance + Engineering + Analytics UX

Foundry

One platform for:

Data engineers
Analysts
Governance teams
Operations users
Business users
Shared context + shared lineage + shared objects.

Traditional Cloud

Different tools for:
Engineers
Analysts
Governance
BI users

➡️ Context fragmentation.

🔷 9. Human-in-the-Loop Data Workflows

Foundry

Supports:

Review queues
Approval workflows
Manual overrides
Case investigation
Audit trails tied to data objects
This is rare in cloud analytics stacks.


10. Regulated & Mission-Critical Environment Strength

Foundry is particularly strong where:
Compliance matters
Auditability matters
Access control is strict
Decisions must be traceable
Data + decisions must be linked

Common in:
Defense
Pharma
Finance
Manufacturing
Government

Palantir Foundry is not just a data platform — it is a data operating system that unifies pipelines, governance, lineage, ontology, and operational applications. Traditional cloud platforms can achieve similar outcomes, but typically require integrating and maintaining multiple independent tools.
